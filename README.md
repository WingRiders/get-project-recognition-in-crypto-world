# Guide to Getting Your Project Recognized in the Tier 1 Crypto World

Comprehensive public guide to help brand new protocols and DApps or utility tokens to become recognized, legitimized, and listed on tier 1 platforms.

## Description

In this project, you can find guides that will help you register the protocols, tokens, or DApps on essential tier 1 platforms of the crypto space. We tried to create detailed and comprehensive guides in a format that is easy to follow and understand.

The project is centered around two main goals:
- Facilitate the registration process for crypto projects on essential tier 1 platforms of the crypto space such as CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Cardano-specific registries, making it more straightforward and accessible.
