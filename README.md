# Guide to Getting Your Project Recognized in the Tier1 Crypto World

Comprehensive public guide to help brand new protocols and DApps or utility tokens to become recognized, legitimized, and listed on tier 1 platforms.

## Description

In this project, you can find guides that will help you register the protocols, tokens, or DApps on essential tier 1 platforms of the crypto space. We tried to create detailed and comprehensive guides in a format that is easy to follow and understand.

The project is centered around two main goals:
- Facilitate the registration process for crypto projects on essential tier 1 platforms of the crypto space such as CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Cardano-specific registries, making it more straightforward and accessible.
