# Registration On CoinMarketCap Support Platform

This guide will help you to create an account on the [CoinMarketCap Support platform](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/).

Creating an account is not a mandatory requirement for registering a crypto-asset or exchange, but with an account, it may be more convenient and easier for you to track the result of your application. 

Please note that accounts for [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) and the [CoinMarketCap Support platform](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/) are different.

3. **Follow the "Sign up" link**

    You will be directed to the "Sign In" form where you need to follow the "Sign-up" button

4. **Fill out the registration form**

    You will be directed to the registration form where you need to fill out the following details:
