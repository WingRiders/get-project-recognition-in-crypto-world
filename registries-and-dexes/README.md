## General overview of Cardano-specific registries and explorers

### Cardano token registry

[The Cardano token registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) serves as a fundamental component within the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, offering a database where token issuers can register their assets and associated metadata. Essentially, it acts as a repository for token-related information, including token names, symbols, descriptions, and other pertinent details crucial for token identification and interoperability within the Cardano network.

Token issuers utilize the Cardano token registry to encode and store metadata about their tokens in a standardized format. This metadata provides valuable context and information about the tokens, such as their purpose, properties, and relevant links, ensuring transparency and facilitating seamless interaction with various applications and services within the Cardano ecosystem.

Registering on the Cardano token registry offers numerous benefits, including increased visibility, enhanced interoperability, trust and credibility, accessibility, and compliance. By leveraging the registry, token issuers can effectively promote their tokens, foster ecosystem growth, and contribute to the long-term success of the Cardano blockchain.
