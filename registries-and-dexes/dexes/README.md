# Guide For Opening Pools/Farms And Verifying Tokens On Prominent Cardano DEXes

In this part of the guide, we will walk you through the process of opening pools or farms and verifying tokens on prominent decentralized exchanges (DEXes).

On this page, you can find a general scheme for opening liquidity pools and a list of useful links to the different guides written by the DEX teams.

## General guide for opening pools on Cardano DEXes

Opening pools on various Cardano DEXes is a fairly simple and straightforward process that does not differ much on different platforms. Check the following steps to familiarize yourself with the process of opening your liquidity pool:

1. **Access DEX platform**

    Visit the platform on which you would like to open a liquidity pool and connect to it through a compatible wallet or browser extension.

2. **Go to the interface to create a liquidity pool**

    Navigate to the section with trading pairs and find the button for creating a pool or for adding liquidity.

3. **Choose a token pair for your liquidity pool**

    Select two crypto-assets for which you want to open the pool.

4. **Input Liquidity Amount**

    Input the amount of each token you wish to contribute to the liquidity pool. Ensure that you provide an equal value of both tokens based on the current exchange rate.

5. **Confirm pool creation and sign the transaction**

    Click on the confirmation button to create a transaction for pool creation. After, you can review and sign the transaction and confirm the approval to allow DEX to access the tokens in your wallet.

6. **Wait for Confirmation**

    After confirming the transaction, wait for the blockchain to process the liquidity provision. Once confirmed, you will receive confirmation and your liquidity is added to the pool.

In this section, we described the general instructions for creating a liquidity pool. However, this process may vary slightly between platforms. We recommend checking out [the external resources and official guides section](#external-resources-and-official-guides) to access up-to-date and detailed guides for each DEX.

## External resources and official guides

In this section, we provide you with useful links to the DEXes resources and their official guides which help you to open a liquidity pool or launch and verify your token. Official guides, authored by DEX teams, provide accurate, up-to-date information aligned with the platform's features, ensuring credibility and comprehensiveness. We highly recommend checking them out.
